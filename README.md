In the past years, there has been a rapid growth in the diffusion and development of autonomous driving cars capable of performing perception, planning and control tasks. Yet these systems still face a major challenge when it comes to driving in highly dynamic urban environments. An intelligent driving system should be capable of comprehending the intentions of other road users and anticipating their forthcoming actions. This is extrimely important when dealing with pedestrians at the point of crossing the road as they exhibit highly variable behavior patterns.The most diffused approaches to pedestrian action prediction are trajectory-based, however they are effective when the pedestrians are already crossing or are about to do so, being unable to anticipate the human action. A remedy for these drawbacks is to predict the action by estimating its underlying cause or intention. Intention estimation allows one to predict a future situation using expected behaviors rather than merely rely on scene dynamics.Pedestrian intention is represented for each sample as an average response of human experiment participants, rescaled to range [0, 1] and rounded. Then the task becomes a binary classification problem of predicting whether the pedestrian i has an intention of crossing the street, int(i) âˆˆ {0, 1} given a partial observation of local visual context around pedestrian and trajectory.
